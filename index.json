In 2016, Mahsa joined the graduate program at Oregon State University (OSU) where she began her research studies in the laboratory of Prof. Sandra Loesgen and pursued a multi-disciplinary approach to discover new antimicrobial natural products. Mahsa investigated precursor-directed biosynthesis using epigenetic agents to elicit the production of novel fungal secondary metabolites called chalanilines and explored their potency in bioassays. Mahsa also worked on target-directed synthesis of chalanilines in a collaborative project in the Blakemore Research Group in an effort to identify potential new drug leads.\nAfter PhD graduation in 2021, Mahsa started a postdoctoral scholar position in Prof. Hong Moulton laboratory at OSU working on method development to enhance the delivery of morpholino oligomers to cells using peptide conjugates and/or various cross-linkers.\nMahsa enjoys hiking, cooking, and traveling around the world to become familiar with people from different cultures while highly interested in the way they approach science.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"d93f5f23b0846f05e6a542b8cfd149c7","permalink":"https://Athos213.github.io/MoultonResearchGroup/author/mahsa-khoshbakht-phd/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/MoultonResearchGroup/author/mahsa-khoshbakht-phd/","section":"authors","summary":"Mahsa Khoshbakht was born in Tehran, Iran.

A post-doc position at OSU in 1991 with Dr Peter Freeman involved similar skills. Other post-docs at OSU included pharmaceutical analysis with Dr. Jim Ayer and bioanalytical and mass spectrometry research with Dr. Douglas Barofsky Jobs have included investigating agricultural products in S.CA and analytical GC-MS methods for the pulp and paper industry in Corvallis. A long-term stint with Sarepta Therapeutics (AVI Biopharma) from 1998 to 2016 involved development of PMOs. As a Sr. Scientist I managed the MS labs and interacted with chemists and biologists (including Hong) in all levels of R\u0026amp;D. I undertook extensive method development and writing of SOPS/protocols for instrument operation and reporting, based on cGMP/ICH/FDA guidelines. I conducted in-process stability and final release testing for drug substance/drug product and undertook major impurity profile investigations. I wrote extensive technical reports for FDA filings. After Sarepta moved to Cambridge, MS, I happily took up working with Hong again (2 weeks later!) on a part-time basis. I assist in production of PPMOs which includes bench work as well as mass spec analysis. Since moving to Corvallis I have pursued international folk dance, where I met my husband Brian and have made friends from around the world. I love birding, gardening, cats, genealogy and traveling when possible.
