## What can we do for you?
We provide the following delivery-enabled PMOs through collaboration on grants, contracts, and/or fee for service.

1. Peptide-conjugated Morpholino oligos (PPMOs). PPMOs are effective reagents to study gene
  functions and are currently in clinical trials. We conjugate many peptides to PMOs using various
  conjugation chemistries.
2. Small molecule ligand-conjugated PMOs. Ligand and receptor interaction permits tissue-specific
  delivery of PMOs.

Please <a href="../contact">contact us</a> for any questions regarding services and/or collaboration.
Let's work together!
