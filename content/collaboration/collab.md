    We provide the following delivery enabled PMOs through collaboration on grant
    applications and/or service for fee.

<div style="width: 75%; margin: auto;">
    <ol>
        <li> Peptide-conjugated Morpholino oligos (PPMOs). PPMOs are effective reagents to study gene
             functions and are currently in clinical trials. We conjugate many peptides to PMOs using various
             conjugation chemistries.
        </li>
        <li>
            Small molecule ligand-conjugated PMOs. Ligand and receptor interaction permits tissue-specific
            delivery of PMOs.
        </li>
