    We can provide the following delivery enabled PMOs through collaboration on grant
    applications and/or service for fee.
</div>

<div style="width: 75%; margin: auto;">
    <ol>
        <li> Peptide-conjugated Morpholino oligos (PPMOs). PPMOs are effective reagents to study gene
             functions and in clinical trials. We can conjugate many peptides to PMOs using various
             conjugation chemistries.
        </li>
        <li>
            Small molecule ligand-conjugated PMOs. Ligand and receptor interaction permits tissue-specific
            delivery of PMOs.
        </li>
        <li>
            Protein-conjugated PMOs. Antibody-PMO conjugates are currently in clinical trials. This is
            another tissue-specific way to deliver PMOs to cells.
        </li>
    </ol>
