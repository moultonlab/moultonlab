Morpholino antisense oligos (PMOs), a synthetic DNA analog, block sites on RNA and can
make targeted changes in gene expression. PMOs have been widely used in developmental biology to
bind RNA transcripts in embryos of model organisms. In embryos, PMOs can be conveniently delivered
by microinjection into the cytosol of early zygotes. This has demonstrated the power and flexibility of
the PMO approach when delivery is not an issue. In adult animals, the delivery challenge has inhibited
widespread application of PMOs. PMOs have been slow to enter the pharmaceutical field as
pharmacologically active compounds. This is largely due to their poor uptake across the plasma
membrane of cells.
