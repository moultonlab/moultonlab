The Moulton lab has over 70 years of combined experience in the research and drug development of PMOs, phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligos.
PMOs are a type of antisense oligomers (ASOs) and we have developed new ways for their in-vivo delivery to target RNAs.
This includes conjugating PMOs to peptides, small molecule ligands, and proteins.
Improvement of delivery enables therapeutic use of PMOs for a broad range of diseases.
They continue to be involved in cutting-edge biomedical research in viral, bacterial, and genetic diseases as well as cancers.
We are funded by grants from NIH, DoD, USDA, private foundations, and industrial contracts.
We supply our delivery-enabled PMOs to academic and industrial communities for research and drug development.

Our lab also provides PMO conjugation service for fee and/or collaboration.
