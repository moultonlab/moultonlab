Our lab develops new ways for in vivo delivery of antisense oligomers (ASOs) such as
phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligos (PMOs) to their target RNAs. We work on to improve delivery of
PMOs into cells in adult tissues, enabling the therapeutic use of PMOs for a broad range of diseases.
With combined experience of over 70 years in the research and drug development of PMOs, the
Moulton lab continues to be involved in cutting-edge biomedical research in viral, bacterial, genetic
diseases as well as cancers. We are funded by grants from NIH, DoD, USDA, private foundations and
industrial contracts. We supply our delivery enabled PMOs to academic and industrial communities for
research and drug development.

Our lab also provides PMO conjugation service for fee and/or collaboration. Please [contact us](./contact) for more information.
We can conjugate PMOs to peptides, small molecule ligands, and proteins.
