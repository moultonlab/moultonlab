My career as a scientist began in 101 Chemistry and a work-study job in
the Physical Science Dept,. at Mesa AZ Comm. College. Who knew? I thought I would be an
ornithologist. I undertook organic synthesis with photochemical and NMR analyses to obtain
my PhD from AZ State University in 1989. A post-doc position at OSU in 1991 with Dr Peter Freeman
involved similar skills. Other post-docs at OSU included pharmaceutical analysis with Dr. Jim
Ayer and bioanalytical and mass spectrometry research with Dr. Douglas Barofsky Jobs have
included investigating agricultural products in S.CA and analytical GC-MS methods for the pulp
and paper industry in Corvallis. A long-term stint with Sarepta Therapeutics (AVI Biopharma)
from 1998 to 2016 involved development of PMOs. As a Sr. Scientist I managed the MS labs and
interacted with chemists and biologists (including Hong) in all levels of R&amp;D. I undertook
extensive method development and writing of SOPS/protocols for instrument operation and
reporting, based on cGMP/ICH/FDA guidelines. I conducted in-process stability and final release
testing for drug substance/drug product and undertook major impurity profile investigations. I
wrote extensive technical reports for FDA filings. After Sarepta moved to Cambridge, MS, I
happily took up working with Hong again (2 weeks later!) on a part-time basis. I assist in
production of PPMOs which includes bench work as well as mass spec analysis. Since moving to
Corvallis I have pursued international folk dance, where I met my husband Brian and have made
friends from around the world. I love birding, gardening, cats, genealogy and traveling when
possible. I have 2 amazing stepsons and a wonderful daughter-in-law and many great friends in
Corvallis.
