Mahsa Khoshbakht was born in Tehran, Iran. She received a BS degree in Chemistry in 2011 and a MS degree in 2014 in Organic Chemistry with thesis research concerned the development of synthetic methods to generate new bioactive heterocyclic compounds. In 2016, Mahsa joined the graduate program at Oregon State University (OSU) where she began her research studies in the laboratory of Prof. Sandra Loesgen and pursued a multi-disciplinary approach to discover new antimicrobial natural products. Mahsa investigated precursor-directed biosynthesis using epigenetic agents to elicit the production of novel fungal secondary metabolites called chalanilines and explored their potency in bioassays. Mahsa also worked on target-directed synthesis of chalanilines in a collaborative project in the Blakemore Research Group in an effort to identify potential new drug leads.

After PhD graduation in 2021, Mahsa started a postdoctoral scholar position in Prof. Hong Moulton laboratory at OSU working on method development to enhance the delivery of morpholino oligomers to cells using peptide conjugates and/or various cross-linkers.

Mahsa enjoys hiking, cooking, and traveling around the world to become familiar with people from different cultures while highly interested in the way they approach science.
