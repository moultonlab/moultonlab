My long-term research interest is to improve delivery of Morpholinos into cells in adult tissues, enabling the therapeutic use of Morpholinos for treatment of a broad range of diseases. Chemical structures have been found which, when linked to a Morpholino oligo, enhance the delivery of the Morpholinos from blood into the cytosol of cells. I invented a class of compounds, the peptide-linked Morpholino oligos (PPMO), which are in clinical trials and are the workhorse molecules produced in my laboratory for many applications for eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems. I am also studying alternative strategies for enhancing Morpholino delivery in vivo by other chemical modifications and formulations.

PPMOs designed and produced in my lab have been investigated for the following applications:

__Eukaryotic systems:__

- Host and pathogen interactions
- Genetic diseases, including cystic fibrosis, spinal muscular atrophy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy
- Viral pathogens, including SARS-CoV2, Lasse virus, influenza virus, and dengue virus
- Multiple sclerosis
- Cancers

__Prokaryotic systems:__
- Bacterial pathogens that cause coral, oyster, and citrus green diseases
